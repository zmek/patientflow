    "## About snapshots\n",
    "\n",
    "`patientflow` is organised around the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prediction time: A moment in the day at which predictions are to be made, for example 09:30.\n",
    "- Patient snapshot: A summary of data from the EHR capturing is known about a single patient at the prediction time. Each patient snapshot has a date and a prediction time associated with it.\n",
    "- Group snaphot: A set of patients snapshots. Each group snapshot has a date and a prediction time associated with it.\n",
    "- Prediction window: A period of hours that begins at the prediction time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its intended use is with data on hospital visits that are unfinished, to predict whether some outcome (admission from A&E, discharge from hospital, or transfer to another clinical specialty) will happen within the prediction window. What the outcome is doesn't really matter; the same methods can be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "The utility of our approach - and the thing that makes it very generalisable - is that we then build up from the patient-level predictions into a predictions for a whole cohort of patients at a point in time. That step is what creates useful information for bed managers. I show this in later notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `patientflow` your data should be in snapshot form. Here I suggest how to you might prepare your data, starting from past hospital visits that have already finished. I'm going to use some fake data on Emergency Department visits, and imagine that we want to predict whether a patient will be admitted to a ward after they leave the ED, or discharged from hospital. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: In practice, how to *whether a patient was admitted after the ED visit*, and *when they were ready to be admitted*, can be tricky. How do you account for the fact that the patient may wait in the ED for a bed, due to lack of available beds? Likewise, if you are trying to predict discharge at the end of a hospital visit, should that that be the time they were ready to leave, or the time they actually left? Discharge delays are common, due to waiting for medication or transport, or waiting for onward care provision to become available. \n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome that you are aiming for will depend on your setting. You may have to infer when a patient was ready from available data. Suffice to say, think carefully about what it is you are trying to predict, and how you will identify that outcome in data. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I have shown how to create snapshots from finished patient visits. Note that there is a summarisation element going on. Above, there are counts of the number of lab orders, and the latest triage score. In the same vein, you might just take the last recorded heart rate or oxygen saturation level, or the latest value of a lab result. A snapshot loses some of the richness of the full data in an EHR, but with the benefit that you get data that replicates unfinished visits. \n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask why we don't use time series data, to hang on to that richness. The main reason is that hospital visit data can be very patchy, with a lot of missingness. For example, in the ED, a severely ill patient might have enough heart rate values recorded to constitute a time series, while a non-acute patient (say someone with a sprained ankle) might have one or no heart rate measurements. In the case of predicting probability of admission after ED, the absence of data is revealing in itself. By summarising, snapshots allow us to capture that variation in data completeness. \n",
