    "\n",
    "I'm [Zella King](https://github.com/zmek/), a health data scientist in the Clinical Operational Research Unit (CORU) at University College London. Since 2020, I have worked with University College London Hospital (UCLH) on practical tools to improve patient flow through the hospital. With a team from UCLH, I developed a predictive tool that is now in daily use by bed managers at the hospital. \n",
    "\n",
    "The tool we built for UCLH takes a 'snapshot' of patients in the hospital at a point in time, and using data from the hospital's electronic record system, predicts the number of emergency admissions in the next 8 or 12 hours. We are working on predicting discharges in the same way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key principle is that we take data on hospital visits that are unfinished, and predict whether some outcome (admission from A&E, discharge from hospital, or transfer to another clinical specialty) will happen to each of those patients in a window of time. What the outcome is doesn't really matter; the same methods can be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "The utility of our approach - and the thing that makes it very generalisable - is that we then build up from the patient-level predictions into a predictions for a whole cohort of patients at a point in time. That step is what creates useful information for bed managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I show what I mean by a snapshot, and suggest how to prepare them. "

    "This creates a predicted probability of admission for each patient, based on what is known about them at the time of the snapshot. However, bed managers really want predictions for the whole cohort of patients in the ED at a point in time. This is where `patientflow` comes into its own. In the next notebook, I show how to do this. "
